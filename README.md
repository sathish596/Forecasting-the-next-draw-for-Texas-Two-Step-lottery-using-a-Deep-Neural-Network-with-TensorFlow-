## Introduction

This repository provides a deep neural network model built with TensorFlow to forecast the next draw for the Texas Two-Step lottery. The project aims to explore the capabilities of neural networks in predicting lottery outcomes based on historical data. While predicting lottery numbers with high accuracy is extremely challenging and uncertain due to the inherent randomness, this project serves as an interesting application of machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing scripts
- Implementation of a deep neural network using TensorFlow
- Training and evaluation scripts for the model
- Example notebooks for model usage and prediction

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sathish358/Forecasting-the-next-draw-for-Texas-Two-Step-lottery.git
   cd Forecasting-the-next-draw-for-Texas-Two-Step-lottery
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the model for forecasting the next draw, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the data:**
   
   - Ensure you have the historical data for the Texas Two-Step lottery in a CSV file format.
   - Place the CSV file in the `data` directory.

2. **Preprocess the data:**

   Run the data preprocessing script to clean and format the data:

   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

3. **Train the model:**

   Train the deep neural network using the prepared data:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Make predictions:**

   Use the trained model to predict the next draw:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Model Training

The model training script (`train_model.py`) includes the following steps:

1. Loading and preprocessing the historical lottery data.
2. Defining the architecture of the deep neural network using TensorFlow.
3. Training the model on the processed data.
4. Evaluating the model's performance and saving the trained model.

You can customize the model architecture and training parameters by editing the `train_model.py` script.
